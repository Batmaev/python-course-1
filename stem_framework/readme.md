## Installing development environment

1. Install Python

2. You may want to create [a virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)

3. Install the packages we use in development which are listed in `development-requirements.txt`:
```sh
cd ./stem_framework

# (activate virtual environment)

pip install -r development-requirements.txt
```
